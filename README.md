# <img src="https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/img/logo.svg" alt="SAP Cloud SDK" width="30"/> SAP Cloud SDK for AI (for Java)

**SAP Cloud SDK for AI** is the official Software Development Kit (SDK) for **SAP AI Core**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and **Orchestration Service**.

This SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities, such as chat completion, into their Java-based business applications using SAP's Generative AI Hub.
Leverage powerful features like templating, grounding, data masking, and content filtering to build intelligent applications.
The SDK simplifies the setup and interaction with SAP AI Core, allowing you to focus on delivering value through AI integration.

## General Requirements

To use the SDK in a Java application, it is necessary to understand the technical prerequisites and required versions for common dependencies.

- Java 17 or higher.
- Access to an **SAP AI Core Service** instance.

Please refer to [this documentation on **how to connect the SDK to AI Core**](docs/guides/CONNECTING_TO_AICORE.md).

The following table lists the required versions, based on the latest release:

| Dependency             | Minimum Version | Recommended Version |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| JDK                    | 17 (LTS)        | 21 (LTS)            |
| SAP Cloud SDK          | 5.6.0           | latest              |
| (optional) CAP Java    | 3.0.0           | latest              |
| (optional) Spring Boot | 3.0             | latest              |

See [an example `pom.xml` in our Spring Boot application](sample-code/spring-app/pom.xml).

## Getting Started

### What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll use the OpenAI GPT-4o model through the [Orchestration Service of AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration) for generating text.
The application will send a prompt to the AI model and display the generated response.

### Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes you have a **deployment of the Orchestration service available** in the `default` resource group of your AI Core instance.
If you don't have a deployment yet, please refer to [this guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration) on how to create one.

### Add the SDK as a Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.ai.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>orchestration</artifactId>
    <!-- Use the latest version here -->
    <version>${ai-sdk.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Use the Orchestration API

We'll use a `client` to interact with the Orchestration service:

```java
var client = new OrchestrationClient();
```

Next, we'll specify the model we want to use:

```java
var config = new OrchestrationModuleConfig()
        .withLlmConfig(OrchestrationAiModel.GPT_4O);
```

Now we can create our first prompt:

```java
var prompt = new OrchestrationPrompt("Hello world! Why is this phrase so famous?");

var result = client.chatCompletion(prompt, config).getContent();
```

The result will be the text generated by the AI model.

### Run the Application Locally

In order to run the application locally, you need to provide credentials for your AI Core service instance.

For this example we'll use a **service key** and pass it as an **environment variable** to the application.

```shell
cd your-spring-app/

# assuming a bash, for other shells (e.g. PowerShell) see the below documentation
export AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{ "clientid": "...", "clientsecret": "...", "url": "...", "serviceurls": { "AI_API_URL": "..." } }'

# assuming Maven and a Spring Boot application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Please find **detailed instructions** and more examples [in this documentation](docs/guides/CONNECTING_TO_AICORE.md#using-the-aicore_service_key-environment-variable).

### Explore Further Capabilities

Check out the options available for the `OrchestrationPrompt` and `OrchestrationModuleConfig` classes.
You can use templating, content filtering, data masking and more.
Please refer to [this documentation](docs/guides/ORCHESTRATION_CHAT_COMPLETION.md) for more information.

## Build the Project

You can build the project using Maven:

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

This will install the current `SNAPSHOT` version of the project into your local Maven repository.

For SAP internal development, you can also use `SNAPSHOT` builds from the [internal](https://int.repositories.cloud.sap/ui/repos/tree/General/proxy-build-snapshots-cloudsdk/com/sap/ai/sdk) and [internet-facing](https://common.repositories.cloud.sap/artifactory/build-snapshots-cloudsdk/com/sap/ai/sdk/) Artifactory.

## FAQs

### _"How to add a custom header to AI Core requests?"_

The AI SDK leverages the destination concept from the SAP Cloud SDK to manage the connection to AI Core.
This opens up a wide range of possibilities to customize the connection, including adding custom headers.

```java
var service = new AiCoreService();
var service = service.withBaseDestination(
        DefaultHttpDestination.fromDestination(service.getBaseDestination())
          .header("my-header-key", "my-header-value")
          .build()
);
```

For more information, please refer to the [AI Core connectivity guide](./docs/guides/CONNECTING_TO_AICORE.md) and the [SAP Cloud SDK documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/http-destinations).

### _"There's a vulnerability warning `CVE-2021-41251`?"_

This is a known false-positive finding.
Depending on the tooling any product called "SAP Cloud SDK" or similar with a low version number may be marked as vulnerable, incorrectly.
Please consider suppressing the warning, [as we do](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/blob/main/.pipeline/dependency-check-suppression.xml).


### _"Are there any example projects?"_
