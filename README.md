# <img src="https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/img/logo.svg" alt="SAP Cloud SDK" width="30"/> SAP Cloud SDK for AI (for Java)

**SAP Cloud SDK for AI** is the official Software Development Kit (SDK) for **SAP AI Core**, **SAP Generative AI Hub**, and **Orchestration Service**.

This SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities, such as chat completion, into their Java-based business applications using SAP's Generative AI Hub.
Leverage powerful features like templating, grounding, data masking, and content filtering to build intelligent applications.
The SDK simplifies the setup and interaction with SAP AI Core, allowing you to focus on delivering value through AI integration.

## General Requirements

#### Development Environment

These are required on the developer side to build and run applications with the SDK:

* **Java JDK**: 17 or higher (21 LTS recommended).
* **SAP Cloud SDK**: 5.6.0 or later (latest recommended, added as a Maven dependency).

#### SAP AI Core Service instance

To make of use the services supported by the SDK, you need to have access to an SAP AI Core Service instance. Checkout [how to connect](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/guides/connecting-to-ai-core).

#### Optional Integrations

The SDK can be combined with popular Java frameworks. These are not required for core functionality, but version compatibility is listed for reference:

* **Spring AI** â‰¥ 1.0.0
* **Spring Boot** â‰¥ 3.0
* **CAP Java** â‰¥ 3.0.0

ðŸ‘‰ See an [example `pom.xml`](sample-code/spring-app/pom.xml) in our sample Spring Boot application.

> [!WARNING]  
> All classes under any of the `...model` packages are generated from an OpenAPI specification and marked as `@Beta`.
> This means that these model classes are not guaranteed to be stable and may change with future releases.
> They are safe to use, but may require updates even in minor releases.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Build

In this quickstart, you'll use the OpenAI GPT-4o model through the [Orchestration Service of AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration) for generating text.
The application will send a prompt to the AI model and display the generated response.

### Prerequisites

This quickstart assumes you have a **deployment of the Orchestration service available** in the `default` resource group of your AI Core instance.
If you don't have a deployment yet, please refer to [this guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration) on how to create one.

### Add the SDK as a Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.ai.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>orchestration</artifactId>
    <!-- Use the latest version here -->
    <version>${ai-sdk.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Use the Orchestration API

We'll use a `client` to interact with the Orchestration service:

```java
var client = new OrchestrationClient();
```

Next, we'll specify the model we want to use:

```java
var config = new OrchestrationModuleConfig()
        .withLlmConfig(OrchestrationAiModel.GPT_4O);
```

Now we can create our first prompt:

```java
var prompt = new OrchestrationPrompt("Hello world! Why is this phrase so famous?");

var result = client.chatCompletion(prompt, config).getContent();
```

The result will be the text generated by the AI model.

### Run the Application Locally

In order to run the application locally, you need to provide credentials for your AI Core service instance.

For this example we'll use a **service key** and pass it as an **environment variable** to the application.

```shell
cd your-spring-app/

# assuming a bash, for other shells (e.g. PowerShell) see the below documentation
export AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{ "clientid": "...", "clientsecret": "...", "url": "...", "serviceurls": { "AI_API_URL": "..." } }'

# assuming Maven and a Spring Boot application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Please find **detailed instructions** and more examples [in this documentation](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/guides/connecting-to-ai-core#using-the-aicore_service_key-environment-variable).

### Explore Further Capabilities

Check out the options available for the `OrchestrationPrompt` and `OrchestrationModuleConfig` classes.
You can use templating, content filtering, data masking and more.
Please refer to [this documentation](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/guides/orchestration-chat-completion) for more information.

## FAQs

### _"How to add a custom header to AI Core requests?"_

The AI SDK leverages the destination concept from the SAP Cloud SDK to manage the connection to AI Core.
This opens up a wide range of possibilities to customize the connection, including adding custom headers.
The following shows how to add custom headers to all requests sent to AI Core.

```java
var service = new AiCoreService();
var destination =
    DefaultHttpDestination.fromDestination(service.getBaseDestination())
        .header("my-header-key", "my-header-value")
        .build();

// AI Core client
service = service.withBaseDestination(destination);
DeploymentApi client = new DeploymentApi(service);
```

For more information, please refer to the [AI Core connectivity guide](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/guides/connecting-to-ai-core) and the [SAP Cloud SDK documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/http-destinations).

There is also a convenient method to add custom headers to single calls through the Orchestration or OpenAI client.

```java
var client = new OrchestrationClient();

var result = client.withHeader("my-header-key", "my-header-value").chatCompletion(prompt, config);
```

For more information on this feature, see the respective documentation of the [OrchestrationClient](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/orchestration/chat-completion#custom-headers) and [OpenAIClient](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/docs/java/foundation-models/openai/chat-completion#custom-headers).

### _"There's a vulnerability warning `CVE-2021-41251`?"_

This is a known false-positive finding.
Depending on the tooling any product called "SAP Cloud SDK" or similar with a low version number may be marked as vulnerable, incorrectly.
Please consider suppressing the warning, [as we do](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/blob/main/.pipeline/dependency-check-suppression.xml).


### _"Are there any example projects?"_
